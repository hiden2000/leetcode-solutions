# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in Python and Go. The solutions are organized by programming language and problem difficulty to make navigation and reference easier.

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── python/
│   ├── easy/
│   ├── medium/
│   └── hard/
├── go/
│   ├── easy/
│   ├── medium/
│   └── hard/
└── README.md
```

- The `python/` and `go/` directories contain solutions in their respective languages.
- Within each language directory, problems are further categorized by difficulty: `easy/`, `medium/`, and `hard/`.
- Each solution file is named using the format: `problem_number_problem_name.extension`
  (e.g., `001_two_sum.py` or `053_maximum_subarray.go`)

## File Structure

Each solution file follows this structure:

1. Problem link and description
2. Approach explanation
3. Time and space complexity analysis
4. Solution code
